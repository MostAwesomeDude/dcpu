\ here's a replacement repl that checks after each line for stack underflow.
\ surprisingly, because of the memory layout, this simple change is enough to
\ catch a lot of problems before the heap is damaged.
\ to use it, just run 'quit2'
: quit2   cr  r0 @ rsp!  begin refill drop
    interpret 0= if abort" ERROR" then  
    dsp@ s0 @ u> if abort" stack underflow" then
    ." ok " cr again ;

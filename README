DCPU-16 Playground

This is an emulator, assembler, and a (still primitive) implementation of
the Forth programming language for notch's DCPU-16.

See: http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt

In order to get up and running, I've augmented the DCPU instruction set with 
four new instructions (all in non-basic format):
  kbd: check for a keypress, store the ascii code in the 'a' argument
  out: emit the ascii code in the 'a' argument to the terminal
  img: dump ram to the file core.img, from address 0x0000 to (but not
       including) the address in the 'a' argument. if 'a' is 0, dump the
	   entire heap (0x0000 to 0x10000)
  die: exit the emulator
  dbg: enter the emulator debugger
The latter two instructions are only used in special cases and are easily 
avoided. 'img' is needed only to bootstrap the forth image.

The first two, however, are required in order to both bootstrap and run
the provided forth image, so forth.img is not portable to other emulators
unless they implement kbd and out.

The built-in disassembler includes code from Brian Swetlands DCPU-16 emulator,
see the file disassemble.c for license and copyright info.

To build, just run:
  make
To run the forth.img:
  ./forth
Other images can be run with:
  ./dcpu blah.img
